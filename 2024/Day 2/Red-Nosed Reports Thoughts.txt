Part 1
Thankfully i understood what I was supposed to do. 
When i searched if theres a sorting command in Python, i realised what increasing/decreasing Monotnic mean.

Learning from my "mistakes" (dont really wanna call them mistakes but, more like things to improve), i realised creating a function that checks if a list is monotonic is really useful since i can reuse it.
The most difficult part was Counting. I couldnt figure out where to actually place the Counting command. Later realised it should be places outside of the loop since im counting a whole list, not the elements within a list.
Figured, its easier to just take a boolean value on whether the difference requirement is met or not.

Part 2
Really learned the usefulness of Functions. Ive of course known about functions for like....years now, but never actually practically used them.
It has always been questions specifically asking me/us to create functions.
Extending my functions to include one to check the difference requirement, then one to check if these conditions are met, then another to check if the conditions are met once a single element is removed was sooo useful. 
But i think i realised that a little later lol.
